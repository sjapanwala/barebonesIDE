## What is Barebones?
### BareBones is a fun project I developed that is essentially an IDE built inside of command terminal, this taught me alot about the intricate details of the insides and out of command prompt on windows 11
### By no means is it a good alternative to many IDE's, this is just a tiny projecti worked on.
